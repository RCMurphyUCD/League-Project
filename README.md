For the first commit, the goal is to create a binary data frame corresponding to champs in the game (1 if yes 0 if no) to better analyze the data from the original 12 col csv file of 202233 rows (game ID, W/L, 5 champs per team). In addition I have added separate column for the number of classes for team 1 and 2. The final file becomes a 271 column data frame with 202233 rows. There is 1 w/l column corresponding to the win or loss of team1, 129x2 champion columns (1 for each team) and an additional 6x2 columns corresponding to the number of primary classes on the team. (tank, support, marksmen, assassin, fighter, mage)
